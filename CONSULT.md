# Code of Consult(ation)

Is consultation better than the quality ("quality properties") or nature(s) of a software-system?

Let's remind ourselves of a reasonable, working list of quality properties of software-systems, shall we? Without question, we do not aim here to "intimidate" but we also do not want to under-estimate the nature of our creative and business efforts, nor do we wish to haphazardly subject our customers, people, to chaos in their business domains: B2C, M2M, C2C (Peer2Peer, peerlessness, radical finitude with functionally ultimate autonomy, anybody?; see François Laruelle[1], then Dwayne Tunstall[2]), B2M, etc., for interoperability in semantic web raises all sites.
