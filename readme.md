# Proposal Planning

Let's be frank: web design was a mistake. You're not paying me just to hit the 
market when 90% of the web is inaccessible. You're paying me because you want 
to show good faith *and* good will here on earth. We're not going to dance 
about secularization or its opposite. You're not going to lecture me about 
your religions as a means to smuggle in Business Requirements you didn't 
think of until last minute. You're not going to tell me anything I say is 
"simply unfair." You're not going to pay me (just) to solve "your" "problem", 
if for no other reason than that you know you need someone other than 
yourself to even articulate your problem. And you know I've been called 
not nothing but other than "articulate". You're not suspicious of "grifts" 
or scams, for no other reason than what we know. You're not feeling 
intimidated, as you have no idea what it is like to make a living in 
a web that is 90% inaccessible, a web where Roy Fielding's research 
has been jacked. No, someone else being informed in historical and 
political facts of the distribution of ownership is not "intimidating" 
you. You probably don't even have the language to communicate what 
or how you feel, and you know this society show has propped itself 
up on finding innocent victims to cry about, fancifully associating 
freedom feelings with whatever or whomever it needs to invent to 
"get the job done". Well, now we know I am vetted by constituents 
of the W3C. You acknowledge standards and their technologies all 
around you: so now why are you coming just to kick me in the history 
with a "time to market" mantra? We're people of and for good will 
as much as we are from good faiths, many of them. And now you know 
that "unconscious price deranges social value"[1].
