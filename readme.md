# Proposal Planning

Let's be frank, [Andy Clarke-style][clarke]: web design was a mistake. And all education 
is violence[1]. You're not paying me just to hit the 
market when [90% of the web is inaccessible][inaccessible]. And accessibility *is* security and 
privacy; elsewhere: almost none of it is build "on" "transformative APIs"; 
that means no sandwiches for you! You're aware of who Bezos is, and how his 
API Mandate has constrained your business valid logic's capabilities, hindered 
interrelations among and between others in the web and its search engine 
results pages and your peers, obscured and obfuscated the attributes, 
semantics and meaning-making potential of your business -- to the point of 
seeming to house it in a digital time capsule whereof you set it and "forget 
it". Why should "designers" be giving humans *static web junk* like debris in 
space, lacking any possibility of semiotic autopoiesis? Ah, we're all just 
slingin' "clever" poetic licenses in this wild, wild web, is it? How would you 
honestly know, if not but for true belief and the right to ask about "the 
terror of value"[2]?

You're paying me because you want to show good faith *and* good will here on 
earth. We're not going to dance about secularization or its opposite. 

You're not going to lecture me about your religions as a means to smuggle in 
Business Requirements you didn't think of until last minute. You're not going 
to tell me anything I say is "simply unfair." You're not going to pay me (just) to solve "your" "problem", 
if for no other reason than that you know you need someone other than 
yourself to even articulate your problem. And you know I've been called 
not nothing but other than "articulate". You're not suspicious of "grifts" 
or scams, for no other reason than what we know. You're not feeling 
intimidated, as you have no idea what it is like to make a living in 
a web that is 90% inaccessible, a web where Roy Fielding's research 
has been jacked. No, someone else being informed in historical and 
political facts of the distribution of ownership is not "intimidating" 
you. You probably don't even have the language to communicate what 
or how you feel, and you know this society show has propped itself 
up on finding innocent victims to cry about, fancifully associating 
freedom feelings with whatever or whomever it needs to invent to 
"get the job done". Well, now we know I am vetted by constituents 
of the W3C. You acknowledge standards and their technologies all 
around you: so now why are you coming just to kick me in the history 
with a "time to market" mantra? We're people of and for good will 
as much as we are from good faiths, many of them. And now you know 
that "unconscious price deranges social value"[2].

It's not (just) about code. You should be worried if your engineer 
or developer, web or full-stuck, cannot reason about complex things 
nor articulate without code in view, as if good programming is not 
about design-first, data structures, and relationships, for "beauty 
is the givenness of data."[4]

And if you don't care if you engineers can articulate the philosophy 
of the web[5]? And you expect them to secure your business logic? 

Do you really want a website, if "want is logically prior to need"? 
Or if trust is logically prior to desire?
