# Proposal Planning

## TL;DR

You want a website, because "want is logically prior to need" (Dark Ecology. 
Timothy Morton.), and we all, or most of us, are fairly sure that "the terror 
of value" depends on a "shared understanding" (Mike Amundsen) that grounds 
trust: what we monitor, what we observe, what we learn, how we grow with the 
art of business. Indeed, Jack, once CEO of a website, himself admitted: "apps 
have distracted me from the power of the web." Ah, but was it (just) apps and 
a market surface?

Oh, "graceful degradation"? "Progressive enhancement"? "Mobile-first"? 
"Design-first"? "API-first?" "TDD"? "IoT"? "Captioning?" "Localization"? "BIPS"? 
"Smart" contracts, "smart" that? "[handshake wallets][handshake]"? "the 
ecological impact of hash-cracking"? Is the browser war still on? "timbl 
invented what?!" "rms hates javascript!?" How ever does one decide what to do 
in how things are going in the web of things, or the "most hostile development 
environment imaginable" (Douglas Crockford, programmer)?

## The State of Play

Let's be frank, [Andy Clarke-style][clarke]: web design was [a mistake][mistake]. 
The very "stuff happening" between "you" and "I", client and creator, is 
grounded in metaphor: "all memories are screen memories"[3], and the screen is nothing like paper, I assure you.
But you need to transact — and transform your business, not (just) let somebody 
else mind it. Indeed, "transformative" is not (just) another [buzzword][buzz]. And all 
education is violence[1]. You're not paying me just to hit the 
market when [90% of the web is inaccessible][inaccessible]. [Mobile website 
speeds have not increased in 10 years][needforspeed] yet our ISPs have improved our download 
performances, you ask? Yet all the major developer teams in their Major Company Dev 
Shops have their own Way? A regular tragedy of the commons, if you ask me. And accessibility *is* security and 
privacy; elsewhere: almost none of it is build "on" "transformative APIs"[6]; 
that means no sandwiches for you! You're aware of who Bezos is, and how his 
[API Mandate][apimandate] has constrained your business valid logic's capabilities, hindered 
interrelations among and between others in the web and its search engine 
results pages and your peers, obscured and obfuscated the attributes, 
semantics and meaning-making potential of your business -- to the point of 
seeming to house it in a digital time capsule whereof you set it and "forget 
it". Why should "designers" be giving humans *static web junk* like debris in 
space, lacking any possibility of semiotic autopoiesis? Ah, we're all just 
slingin' "clever" poetic licenses in this wild, wild web, is it? How would you 
honestly know, if not but for true belief and the right to ask about "the 
terror of value"[2]?

You're paying me because you want to show good faith *and* good will here on 
earth. We're not going to dance about secularization or its opposite. 

You're not going to lecture me about your religions as a means to smuggle in 
Business Requirements you didn't think of until last minute. You're not going 
to tell me anything I say is "simply unfair." You're not going to pay me (just) to solve "your" "problem", 
if for no other reason than that you know you need someone other than 
yourself to even articulate your problem. And you know I've been called 
not nothing but other than "articulate". You're not suspicious of "grifts" 
or scams, for no other reason than what we know. You're not feeling 
intimidated, as you have no idea what it is like to make a living in 
a web that is 90% inaccessible, a web where Roy Fielding's research 
has been jacked. No, someone else being informed in historical and 
political facts of the distribution of ownership is not "intimidating" 
you. You probably don't even have the language to communicate what 
or how you feel, and you know this society show has propped itself 
up on finding innocent victims to cry about, fancifully associating 
freedom feelings with whatever or whomever it needs to invent to 
"get the job done". Well, now we know I am vetted by constituents 
of the W3C. You acknowledge standards and their technologies all 
around you: so now why are you coming just to kick me in the history 
with a "time to market" mantra? We're people of and for good will 
as much as we are from good faiths, many of them. And now you know 
that "unconscious price deranges social value"[3].

It's not (just) about code. You should be worried if your engineer 
or developer, web or full-stuck, cannot reason about complex things 
nor articulate without code in view, as if good programming is not 
about design-first, data structures, and relationships, for "beauty 
is the givenness of data."[4]

And if you don't care if your engineers can articulate [the philosophy 
of the web][phil][5]? And you expect them to secure your business logic? 

Do you really want a website, if "want is logically prior to need"? 
Or if trust is logically prior to desire?

And certainly I've said a bit here. "You" and "I" might even think 
this document's style has broken with the original stylistic constraints 
laid out by Clarke, in his rejection of legalese. You may not think 
the neoclassical, Sisyphean economy's formula, P=R+W+I, has anything 
to do with your bottom-line — 

Because it's all (just) math, right? Software is eating the world[7], ya say?

Let's not go about misdocumenting as if concern for "everyday racial coding"[8] 
and "pattern discrimination"[9] are just as much valid concerns, just as 
valuable, as a game theory no one wishes to admit bit the dust long ago[10]. To say 
the least, it's not all (just) about game theory, a world as a hare-hunt.

Because we're playfully serious, when we must be, and seriously playful 
when we can, "you" and "I" should hope.
