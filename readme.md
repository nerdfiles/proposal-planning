# Proposal Planning

## TL;DR

You want a website, because "want is logically prior to need" (Dark Ecology. 
Timothy Morton.), and we all, or most of us, are fairly sure that "the terror 
of value" depends on a "shared understanding" (Mike Amundsen) that grounds 
trust: what we monitor, what we observe, what we learn, how we grow with the 
art of business. Indeed, Jack, once CEO of a website, himself admitted: "apps 
have distracted me from the power of the web." Ah, but was it (just) apps and 
a market surface?

Oh, "graceful degradation"? "Progressive enhancement"? "Mobile-first"? 
"Design-first"? "API-first?" "TDD"? "domain-driven design" (or should these be 
capitalized D's)? IoT"? "Captioning?" "Localization"? "BIPS"? 
"Smart" contracts, "smart" that? "[handshake wallets][handshake]"? "the 
ecological impact of hash-cracking"? Is the browser war still on? "timbl 
invented what?!" "rms hates javascript!?" How ever does one decide what to do 
in how things are going in the web of things, or the "most hostile development 
environment imaginable" (Douglas Crockford, programmer)?

## The State of Play

Let's be frank, [Andy Clarke-style][clarke]: web design was and is [a mistake][mistake]. 
The very "stuff happening" between "you" and "I", client and creator, is 
grounded in metaphor: "all memories are screen memories"[3], and the screen is nothing like paper, I assure you.
But you need to transact — and transform your business, not (just) let somebody 
else mind it. Indeed, "transformative" is not (just) another [buzzword][buzz]. And all 
education is violence[1]. You're not paying "me," one who "leverages" an open source and/or free software movement, just to hit the 
market surface when [90% of the web is inaccessible][inaccessible]. [Mobile website 
speeds have not increased in 10 years][needforspeed] yet our ISPs have improved "our" download 
and latency performances, you ask? As all the major developer teams in their Major Company [Developer Developer Developer Developer][dev4]
Shops have their own Way, as any "tech recruiter" is only authorized to say? (*career of 15 years going strong!, but what do I know?*)

(We see you Comcast, SAP, VMWare, Dun & Bradstreet, Microsoft selling personally identifiable data to ICE, advertising "REST APIs", not "REST*ful*"; i.e., "transformative", and hey, please articulate why [MUST][rfc2119] hypermedia control *not* be used in GraphQL again, for "[conveyor-tube][tube]" messaging "data APIs"?) 

A regular tragedy of the commons, if you ask me. And who really asks anything 
about anything anymore, all the Major Companies giving no feedback due to 
their security policies — lacking ODRL? GDPR? Even jazz was "[conceived to be 
about something][jazz]"! They're all doing the "best for the best customers with the best tools at the best times in the best SDLCs"? 
But then, [accessibility *is* security and privacy][privacy]; elsewhere: 
almost none of it is built ("buidl'd"?) "on" "transformative APIs"[6]; that means no 
[sandwiches][swiber][15] for you! You're aware of who Jeff Bezos is, and how his 
[API Mandate][apimandate] has constrained your business valid logic's capabilities, hindered 
interrelations among and between others in the web and its search engine 
results pages and your peers, obscured and obfuscated the attributes, 
semantics and meaning-making potential of your business -- to the point of 
seeming to house it in a digital time capsule whereof you set it and "forget 
it". Why should "designers" be giving humans *static web junk* like debris in 
space, lacking any possibility of semiotic autopoiesis? Ah, we're all just 
slingin' "clever" poetic licenses in this wild, wild web, is it? How would you 
honestly know, if not but for true belief and the right to ask about "the 
terror of value"[2]?

You're paying me because you want to show good faith *and* good will here on 
earth. We're not going to dance about secularization or its opposite. 

You're not going to lecture me about your cultural religions nor political ableisms as a means to smuggle in 
Business Requirements you didn't think of until last minute. You're not going 
to tell me anything I say is "simply unfair." You're not going to pay me (just) to solve "your" "problem", 
if for no other reason than that you know you need someone other than 
yourself to even articulate your problem. And you know I've been called 
not nothing but other than "articulate". You're not suspicious of "grifts" 
or scams, for no other reason than what we know about how the empire of law codes 
capital for everything we perceive in virtual stores and otherwise[15], from 
cans of soup to NFTs to our personas as products. You're not feeling 
intimidated, as you have no idea what it is like to make a living in 
a web that is 90% inaccessible, a web where Roy Fielding's research 
has been jacked. No, someone else being informed in historical and 
political facts of the distribution of ownership is not "intimidating" 
you. You probably don't even have the language to communicate what 
or how you feel, and you know this society show has propped itself 
up on finding innocent victims to cry about, fancifully associating 
freedom feelings with whatever or whomever it needs to invent to 
"get the job done". Well, now we know I am vetted by constituents 
of the W3C. You acknowledge standards and their technologies all 
around you: so now why are you coming just to kick me in the history 
with a "time to market" mantra? We're people of and for good will 
as much as we are from good faiths, many of them. And now you know 
that "unconscious price deranges social value"[3].

It's not (just) about code. You should be worried if your engineer 
or developer, web or full-stuck, cannot reason about complex things 
nor articulate without code in view, as if good programming is not 
about design-first, data structures, and relationships, for "beauty 
is the givenness of data."[4]

And if you don't care if your engineers can articulate [the philosophy 
of the web][phil][5]? And you expect them to secure your business logic? 

Do you really want a website, if "want is logically prior to need"? 
Or if trust is logically prior to desire?

And certainly I've said a bit here. "You" and "I" might even think 
this document's style has broken with the original stylistic constraints 
laid out by Clarke, in his rejection of legalese. You may not think 
the neoclassical, [Sisyphean economy's formula][sisyphean][11], `P=R+W+I`, has anything 
to do with your bottom-line — 

Because it's all (just) math, right? Software is eating the world[7], ya say?

Let's not go about [misdocumenting][jazz] as if concern for "everyday racial coding"[8] 
and "pattern discrimination"[9] are just as much valid concerns, just as 
valuable, as a game theory no one wishes to admit bit the dust long ago[10]. To say 
the least, it's not all (just) about game theory, a world as a hare-hunt.

Because we're playfully serious, when we must be; maybe even reasonable in our 
goals, and seriously playful when we can, "you" and "I" should hope.

Tell us again, like when we saw the earth floating in space for the first time[13], 
what did we take away when [Aaron Swartz][swartz] impressively took a stand for the 
fragility of knowledge, showing us the depth of our work to be done?

native apps, technically, if they would be a bit more open about all this, 
since most of them are built using HTTP and other web technologies offered by 
the W3C, anyway), then *see* the "layered" composition of an API response: 
typically as it should be minimally composed of actions (capabilities), (link 
or "relating") relations, attributes or "properties" (as Amundsen notes; and 
again, here, they are modal, contextual, etc., sometimes!), presentational 
modalities of and for hypermedia control (think accessibility; see above!), and 
some sense of *whose time it is* — maybe think of OWL-Time prefixing the 
standard link relations' strings in the <link> tags viewable in the HTML 
source code; or W3C mementos or W3C timegates, even! There is quite a bit to 
all this, and we haven't even mentioned the demands of cryptosystems, semantic 
hashing for speedy lookups, availability vs consistency, metastability and 
"meta APIs"!
